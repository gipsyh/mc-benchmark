-- A model of part of a preliminary version of the system requirements
   specification of TCAS II (Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance
   System II).  TCAS II is an aircraft collision avoidance system
   required on most commercial aircraft in United States.

  Note:  Three variants are provided in the tcas directory.
         "-t" represent cases with additional TRANS expression
	    added to refine the space.
         "16" represent scaled up version.
